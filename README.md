# What's this?

This is a demo Jason Lengstorf ([@jlengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf)) and I ([@0xca0a](https://twitter.com/0xca0a)) were building together in a [learn-with-jason episode on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/477199412). We go into threejs a little, how to install three-fiber, what it is, how to create a simple scene, interaction, animation, game-loop fundamentals, lights, shadows, fog and how to load models.
